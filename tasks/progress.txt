## Codebase Patterns
- Typecheck errors in dist/lib/pkg/ and node_modules/ are pre-existing issues from protobuf generation and dependencies, not from source code changes
- Component exports are centralized in src/ts/component/index.ts
- Popup components are registered in src/ts/component/popup/index.tsx (both import and Components object)
- When removing a feature, make functions no-ops rather than deleting them to avoid breaking callers
- Settings sidebar items are in src/ts/component/sidebar/page/settings/index.tsx
- Settings page components are registered in src/ts/component/page/main/settings/index.tsx
- Menu components are registered in src/ts/component/menu/index.tsx (both import and Components object)
- Publishing-related commands are in lib/api/command.ts under the PUBLISHING section
- Share button in headers is controlled by showShare variable - set to false to hide
- Invite popups (confirm, qr, request) and share popup are registered in popup/index.tsx Components object
- Space settings invite/qr/copyLink buttons are in getButtons() in settings/space/index.tsx
- Join notification handling is in notification/index.tsx case I.NotificationType.Join
- U.Common.onInviteRequest() and U.Menu.inviteContext() are utility wrappers for invite UI
- PopupSpaceJoinByLink routes to /main/invite/ page - both need to be addressed together
- Analytics is in src/ts/lib/analytics.ts - uses Amplitude, ~313 event calls across ~147 files. Gut the class to no-ops rather than touching callers. Keep the route object (used as string constants)
- Sentry is initialized in app.tsx with DSN from rspack DefinePlugin, also used in dispatcher.ts and data.ts
- Electron debug flags are in electron/js/menu.js in the `flags` object
- Electron auto-update is managed by electron/js/update.js (UpdateManager) using electron-updater. It's used from: electron.js (init), api.js (API handlers), menu.js (menu items + tray), and app.tsx (IPC event handlers)
- Update UI has two display points: vault sidebar (vault/update.tsx as ItemProgress) and ListBanner (list/banner.tsx)
- The vault sidebar (vault.tsx) injects an update-progress item into the space list via getItems() when updateVersion or progress exists
- **Browser testing:** Start heart server with TWO ports: `anytype-heart/dist/server 127.0.0.1:0 127.0.0.1:0` — the first is gRPC, the second is the **gRPC-web proxy** (look for `gRPC Web proxy started at:` in stdout). Use the **web proxy** address for `ANYTYPE_USE_SIDE_SERVER`. Then start Electron: `SERVER_PORT=8080 ANYTYPE_USE_SIDE_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:<WEB_PROXY_PORT> npx electron . --remote-debugging-port=9222`. Must call `C.InitialSetParameters` before AccountCreate when using external server — call it via CDP on first launch, then restart Electron (the server remembers ISP was called). Access internal modules via `webpackChunkanytype.push([['_'], {}, function(req) { __webpack_require__ = req; }])`
- **Browser testing navigation:** To navigate to settings pages via CDP: find the Action module via webpack (`m.Action && m.Action.openSettings`), then call `Action.openSettings('pageId', 'settings')`

## 2026-02-07 - US-006
- What was implemented: Removed space sharing settings pages
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/sidebar/page/settings/index.tsx - Removed spaceShare from sidebar menu
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/index.tsx - Removed PageSpaceShare import, registration, and from SPACE_PAGES
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/share.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/lib/action.ts - Made openSpaceShare a no-op
  - src/ts/lib/keyboard.ts - Removed spaceShare from navigation handler
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Space share settings had a keyboard.ts reference for back navigation handling
  - The share.tsx component imports a Members sub-component from share/members.tsx - stubbing share.tsx makes members.tsx unreachable too
  - Action.openSpaceShare is called from other places - making it a no-op is safer than tracking all callers

---

## 2026-02-07 - US-005
- What was implemented: Removed publishing UI, commands, and sidebar item
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/sidebar/page/settings/index.tsx - Removed dataPublish from sidebar menu
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/index.tsx - Removed PageDataPublish import and registration
  - src/ts/lib/api/command.ts - Removed Publishing* commands (PublishingCreate, PublishingRemove, PublishingList, PublishingResolveUri, PublishingGetStatus)
  - src/ts/component/menu/index.tsx - Removed MenuPublish import and registration
  - src/ts/component/header/main/object.tsx - Disabled share button (showShare = false), made onShare no-op
  - src/ts/component/header/main/history.tsx - Disabled share button (showShare = false), made onShare no-op
  - src/ts/component/editor/page.tsx - Removed 'publish' from menuCheck
  - src/ts/component/menu/publish.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/data/publish.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/data/index.tsx - Removed PublishingList call and unused state
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Publishing involves multiple UI touchpoints: settings sidebar, settings page, object header share button, history header share button, editor menuCheck
  - The share button in headers opens the publish menu - disabling publishing means disabling the share button
  - Stubbing components to return null is cleaner than deleting them when imports still exist elsewhere

## 2026-02-07 - US-003
- What was implemented: Completed removal of membership popups and UpsellBanner component
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/popup/index.tsx - Removed imports and registrations for PopupMembership, PopupMembershipActivation, PopupMembershipFinalization
  - src/ts/component/index.ts - Removed UpsellBanner import and export
  - src/ts/component/menu/syncStatus.tsx - Removed UpsellBanner import and usage
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/storage.tsx - Removed UpsellBanner import and usage
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/share.tsx - Removed UpsellBanner import and usage
  - src/ts/lib/action.ts - Made membershipUpgrade and membershipUpgradeViaEmail no-ops
  - src/ts/component/menu/identity.tsx - Made onClick no-op
  - src/ts/component/menu/syncStatus/info.tsx - Made upgradeMembership case no-op
  - src/ts/component/page/auth/setup.tsx - Simplified cb1 to skip membership finalization check
  - src/ts/component/page/main/membership.tsx - Simplified init to just redirect to dashboard
  - src/ts/component/popup/invite/confirm.tsx - Made onMembership no-op
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The membership popup had 3 variants: main, activation, and finalization - all need to be removed together
  - UpsellBanner was used in syncStatus menu, storage settings, and share settings
  - Action.membershipUpgrade is called from multiple places - making it a no-op is safer than finding all callers
  - Page components can be left in place if they're unreachable from routes/sidebar

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-007
- What was implemented: Removed invite popups, invite page, share popup, and space join notification handling
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/popup/index.tsx - Removed imports and registrations for PopupInviteRequest, PopupInviteConfirm, PopupInviteQr, PopupShare, PopupSpaceJoinByLink
  - src/ts/component/popup/invite/confirm.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/popup/invite/qr.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/popup/invite/request.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/popup/share.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/popup/space/joinByLink.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/page/main/invite.tsx - Stubbed to redirect to dashboard
  - src/ts/component/page/main/object.tsx - Changed invite redirect to go to dashboard instead
  - src/ts/component/notification/index.tsx - Removed Join notification buttons and inviteConfirm popup opening
  - src/ts/component/menu/help.tsx - Removed 'share' menu item and its handler
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/index.tsx - Made getButtons() return empty array (removed invite/copyLink/qr)
  - src/ts/lib/util/common.ts - Made onInviteRequest a no-op
  - src/ts/lib/util/menu.ts - Made inviteContext a no-op
  - src/ts/store/popup.ts - Removed 'inviteQr' from NO_DIMMER_IDS
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Invite flow has many touchpoints: popup components, page route, notification handler, space settings buttons, help menu, utility functions
  - PopupSpaceJoinByLink navigates to /main/invite/ page - removing the invite page means also stubbing joinByLink
  - page/main/object.tsx has a redirect to invite page when cid/key params present - needs to redirect to dashboard in offline mode
  - The help menu has a 'share' item that opens the share popup (share the Anytype app link) - distinct from space sharing
  - Space settings index has getButtons() that returns invite/copyLink/qr buttons based on cid/key state
- NotificationList/NotificationReply are used for general notifications (import/export/gallery), not just sharing - keep them
- Action.inviteRevoke is a wrapper that calls C.SpaceInviteRevoke - make it a no-op when removing the command
- U.Space.getInvite wraps C.SpaceInviteGetCurrent - make it a no-op when removing the command
- share/members.tsx uses C.SpaceRequestDecline, C.SpaceParticipantRemove, C.SpaceRequestApprove, C.SpaceParticipantPermissionsChange - must be stubbed even though unreachable
- Space create popup auto-shares chat spaces via C.SpaceMakeShareable + C.SpaceInviteGenerate - remove for offline mode

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-010
- What was implemented: Removed sync state tracking from auth store and removed DeviceList, DebugNetCheck, AccountRecover gRPC commands
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/store/auth.ts - Removed syncStatusMap field, made syncStatusUpdate a no-op, made getSyncStatus return default offline status, made getNotSynced return zero, removed syncStatusMap.clear() from clearAll, cleaned up unused intercept import
  - src/ts/lib/api/command.ts - Removed AccountRecover, DebugNetCheck, DeviceList commands
  - src/ts/lib/api/response.ts - Removed DebugNetCheck, DeviceList response handlers
  - src/ts/lib/api/dispatcher.ts - Made SpaceSyncStatusUpdate/P2PStatusUpdate handler a no-op
  - src/ts/lib/keyboard.ts - Made debugNet keyboard shortcut handler a no-op
  - src/ts/component/page/auth/login.tsx - Replaced C.AccountRecover with stored accountId lookup for offline-only login
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AccountRecover is used in login.tsx for network-based account discovery after WalletRecover - in offline mode, use Storage.get('accountId') instead
  - The login flow works: WalletRecover → createSession → accountAdd with stored ID → select() picks up via useEffect → AccountSelect completes login
  - DebugNetCheck is only called from keyboard.ts debugNet shortcut handler
  - DeviceList had no callers in the codebase - was likely intended for future P2P device management UI
  - getSyncStatus and getNotSynced callers were already removed in US-009, so making them return defaults is safe
  - syncStatusUpdate is called from dispatcher.ts for SpaceSyncStatusUpdate and P2PStatusUpdate events - made it a no-op

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-008
- What was implemented: Removed all 13 space sharing/invite gRPC commands and their references
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/lib/api/command.ts - Removed SpaceInviteGenerate, SpaceInviteChange, SpaceInviteView, SpaceInviteRevoke, SpaceInviteGetCurrent, SpaceStopSharing, SpaceMakeShareable, SpaceJoin, SpaceJoinCancel, SpaceRequestApprove, SpaceRequestDecline, SpaceParticipantPermissionsChange, SpaceParticipantRemove
  - src/ts/lib/api/response.ts - Removed SpaceInviteGenerate, SpaceInviteGetCurrent, SpaceInviteView response handlers
  - src/ts/lib/action.ts - Made inviteRevoke a no-op
  - src/ts/lib/util/space.ts - Made getInvite a no-op
  - src/ts/component/popup/space/create.tsx - Removed isChatSpace auto-sharing (SpaceMakeShareable + SpaceInviteGenerate)
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/share/members.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/lib/api/dispatcher.ts - Removed SpaceInviteGetCurrent from SKIP_SENTRY_ERRORS
  - src/json/error.ts - Removed SpaceInviteView and SpaceJoin error codes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - NotificationList and NotificationReply are used for general notifications (import/export/gallery), not just sharing - don't remove them
  - The chat space creation flow auto-shares via SpaceMakeShareable + SpaceInviteGenerate - needs to be removed for offline-only
  - Even unreachable components like share/members.tsx must be stubbed if they reference removed exports, because TypeScript still checks them
  - Response handlers in response.ts must also be removed when commands are removed

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-011
- What was implemented: Removed all analytics and telemetry (Amplitude + Sentry)
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/lib/analytics.ts - Gutted entire class: removed Amplitude import, made all methods no-ops (init, event, profile, setProperty, setContext, setTier, setVersion, stackAdd, stackSend, log, etc.), kept route object and typeMapper/embedType/networkType stubs for callers
  - src/ts/app.tsx - Removed Sentry import, Sentry.init() block, Sentry.setContext() call, analytics.init() call
  - src/ts/lib/api/dispatcher.ts - Removed Sentry import, Sentry.captureMessage calls, SKIP_SENTRY_ERRORS constant, analytics Exception event
  - src/ts/lib/util/data.ts - Removed Sentry import and Sentry.setUser() call
  - src/json/constant.ts - Cleared amplitude API key and sentry DSN to empty strings
  - rspack.config.js - Cleared SENTRY_DSN default to empty string
  - src/ts/global.d.ts - Removed SENTRY_DSN global declaration
  - electron/js/menu.js - Removed analytics debug flag from flags menu
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Analytics has ~313 references across ~147 files - gutting the analytics class to no-ops is far safer than touching every caller
  - The analytics module exports a route object that's used as string constants throughout the codebase - must keep this even when disabling tracking
  - analytics.typeMapper() is called from widget/index.tsx for data passed to event() - must keep stub even though event is a no-op
  - Sentry is used in 3 files: app.tsx (init), dispatcher.ts (captureMessage for errors), data.ts (setUser)
  - SENTRY_DSN is injected via rspack DefinePlugin with a default fallback - clear both the env var default and constant.ts
  - The analytics debug flag in Electron menu controls config.debug.analytics which is read by analytics.debug() - removing the flag is cleaner than leaving a dead toggle

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-012
- What was implemented: Removed Electron auto-update functionality
- Files changed:
  - electron/js/update.js - Gutted entire UpdateManager class: removed electron-updater import, made all methods no-ops, isAllowed() returns false
  - electron.js - Removed UpdateManager require, removed setWindow() and init() calls
  - electron/js/api.js - Removed UpdateManager import, made updateCheck/updateDownload/updateConfirm/updateCancel no-ops, removed UpdateManager.relaunch() from shutdown() (now always app.exit(0)), removed UpdateManager.setChannel() from setChannel()
  - electron/js/menu.js - Removed UpdateManager import/isAllowed from initMenu() and initTray(), removed "Check Updates" from main Anytype menu and tray menu, removed version/channel submenu
  - src/ts/app.tsx - Removed update-not-available, update-downloaded, update-error, download-progress IPC event registrations and all four handler functions (onUpdateDownloaded, onUpdateUnavailable, onUpdateError, onUpdateProgress)
  - src/ts/component/sidebar/page/vault/update.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/list/banner.tsx - Stubbed to return null
  - src/ts/component/sidebar/page/vault.tsx - Removed ItemProgress import, removed updateVersion from S.Common, removed progress Update type tracking, removed update-progress item injection in getItems(), removed isProgress branch in rowRenderer, simplified getRowHeight
  - src/ts/lib/util/common.ts - Made checkUpdateVersion a no-op
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The auto-update system spans 4 Electron main process files (update.js, api.js, menu.js, electron.js) and 5 renderer files (app.tsx, vault.tsx, vault/update.tsx, banner.tsx, common.ts)
  - The vault sidebar injects a special "update-progress" item at the top of the space list via getItems() when an update is downloading or available
  - shutdown() in api.js branches on relaunch param: true calls UpdateManager.relaunch() (quitAndInstall), false calls app.exit(0) - in offline mode, always use app.exit(0)
  - The menu.js version/channel submenu uses UpdateManager.isUpdating to prevent channel changes during updates
  - updateVersionSet/updateVersion in store/common.ts are now dead code but kept as harmless stubs
  - ListBanner is exported from component/index.ts - stubbing it to return null is cleaner than removing the export
- **Test plan results:** typecheck pass, lint pass, build:dev pass. Browser console check requires running Electron app with middleware — needs manual verification.

---

## 2026-02-08 - US-013
- What was implemented: Removed online state tracking and simplified network utility functions for offline-only mode
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/store/common.ts - Removed isOnlineValue field, isOnline computed property, isOnlineSet action, and their MobX decorators
  - src/ts/lib/util/data.ts - Made isAnytypeNetwork() always return false, isDevelopmentNetwork() always return false, isLocalNetwork() always return true
  - src/ts/lib/keyboard.ts - Removed S.Common.isOnlineSet(navigator.onLine) initialization and the online/offline window event handler (which also fetched membership tiers)
  - src/ts/component/block/embed.tsx - Replaced S.Common.isOnline with navigator.onLine for embed rendering (Latex/Mermaid render locally; external embeds depend on actual network)
  - src/ts/lib/util/space.ts - Made isShareActive() always return false, simplified getInviteLink() to always use protocol format
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - isOnline tracked navigator.onLine via the store — for features that genuinely depend on actual internet (like embeds), use navigator.onLine directly instead of the store
  - isAnytypeNetwork/isDevelopmentNetwork/isLocalNetwork are checked by several callers (upsell, data settings, phrase settings, isFreeMember) — making them return constants is safer than removing them and touching all callers
  - spaceStorage in common store tracks local storage (bytesLimit, localUsage, spaces[].bytesUsage) — it's NOT remote-only, so it should be kept
  - isFreeMember() uses isAnytypeNetwork() — with it returning false, isFreeMember always returns false, which is correct for offline mode
  - The keyboard.ts online/offline handler also fetched membership tiers on reconnect — removing this is fine since membership is already disabled

---

## 2026-02-09 - US-014
- What was implemented: Cleaned up all online-dependent UI conditionals in component code
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/util/upsell/index.tsx - Simplified to always return null (isAnytypeNetwork() returns false, so canShow was always false)
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/data/index.tsx - Inlined 'LocalOnly' suffix (isLocalNetwork() always true), removed isLocalNetwork variable and ternary conditionals for confirm/cancel labels
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/phrase.tsx - Removed dead delete-account section (!isLocal was always false), removed unused Button import and onPage prop
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - S.Common.isOnline was already fully removed in US-013 — no component references remained
  - embed.tsx uses navigator.onLine (browser native API) not S.Common.isOnline — this is correct for detecting actual internet for external embeds
  - UpsellBanner had complex logic that was entirely dead code since isAnytypeNetwork() returns false — safe to gut entirely
  - phrase.tsx had a delete-account section gated behind !isLocal which was always false in offline mode — removing it is cleaner
  - The lib/ functions (isAnytypeNetwork, isDevelopmentNetwork, isLocalNetwork) are kept as constant-returning stubs for any remaining non-component callers like isFreeMember()

---

## 2026-02-09 - US-015
- What was implemented: Simplified auth flow by removing email verification step, stubbing account deletion pages
- Files changed:
  - src/ts/component/page/auth/onboard.tsx - Removed Stage.Email from enum (renumbered Persona=1, UseCase=2), removed email switch cases from onForward() and render, removed emailRef, onEmailKeyUp, Input/KeyboardEvent imports
  - src/ts/component/page/auth/deleted.tsx - Stubbed to simple logout page (removed C.AccountRevertDeletion, pie chart, export/remove buttons, survey check)
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/delete.tsx - Stubbed to return null (C.AccountDelete not needed for offline-only)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The onboard Stage enum uses integer values that map to string keys for i18n (translate(`authOnboard${Stage[stage]}Title`)) — renumbering stages changes the mapping, but removing Email and keeping Phrase/Persona/UseCase works because the string values match
  - login.tsx was already fully handled in US-010 (AccountRecover replaced with stored accountId lookup)
  - migrate.tsx uses C.AccountMigrate which is a local data format migration — it doesn't require network and should be kept
  - deleted.tsx is reached via two paths: page/index.tsx guard (accountIsDeleted/accountIsPending) and settings/delete.tsx — both still route there but the page is now a simple logout
  - The delete settings page button was already removed from phrase.tsx in US-014 (!isLocal was always false), making delete.tsx unreachable from UI
  - The page/index.tsx auth guard (line 193) still redirects to /auth/deleted if account status is deleted/pending — this is harmless since the stubbed page just shows logout

---

## 2026-02-09 - US-016
- What was implemented: Added offline-only disclaimer to the onboarding vault creation screen
- Files changed:
  - src/json/text.json - Added authOnboardPhraseDisclaimer translation key
  - src/ts/component/page/auth/onboard.tsx - Added disclaimer Label below buttons on Phrase stage
  - src/scss/page/auth.scss - Added .label.disclaimer style in .stagePhrase (text-small, tertiary color, centered, 480px width)
  - tasks/prd.json - Marked US-016 as passing
- **Browser verification:** Confirmed via Playwright CDP connection to Electron. Disclaimer text "This is an offline-only version of Anytype. Your data stays on this device and is never sent to the cloud." renders correctly below Skip button on Phrase stage, styled in tertiary color, centered. Screenshot saved.
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The auth SCSS already had a `.footer .disclaimer` style, but it's scoped to `.footer` — for the onboard page, add the disclaimer style inside `.stagePhrase`
  - The Label component accepts className — using "disclaimer animation" gives it the right class and entrance animation
  - Translation keys for onboarding follow the pattern `authOnboard{Stage}{Element}` (e.g., authOnboardPhraseDisclaimer)
  - The `@include text-small` mixin is available for smaller informational text in SCSS
  - **Browser testing setup:** Start heart server (`/dist/server`), then Electron with `ANYTYPE_USE_SIDE_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:31008 npx electron . --remote-debugging-port=9222`. Connect to CDP targets via `curl http://127.0.0.1:9222/json`, interact via node ws + `Runtime.evaluate`
  - **Critical:** When using ANYTYPE_USE_SIDE_SERVER, must call `C.InitialSetParameters(platform, version, workDir, ...)` before AccountCreate — the external server doesn't receive this automatically. Access C module via webpack: `webpackChunkanytype.push([['_test_'], {}, function(req) { __webpack_require__ = req; }])` then iterate `__webpack_require__.m` to find module with `InitialSetParameters`

---

## 2026-02-09 - US-017
- What was implemented: Replaced remote storage settings with local-only storage view
- Files changed:
  - src/json/text.json - Renamed "Remote Storage" to "Storage", updated storage description to local-only text, added "Files" translation key
  - src/ts/component/page/main/settings/space/storage.tsx - Removed sync status filter (show all files, not just synced), removed onUpgrade method, removed red usage warning class, removed syncStatusRelationKeys usage, renamed "Synced files" to "Files", simplified refManagers to single refManager
  - tasks/prd.json - Marked US-017 as passing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - spaceStorage in common store tracks local storage (bytesLimit, localUsage, spaces[].bytesUsage) — it's genuinely local and useful for offline mode
  - The file manager's syncStatus filter was the main remote-centric piece — removing it shows all files regardless of sync state
  - The "red" usage warning class (`usagePercent >= 100`) was tied to remote storage limits — not meaningful for local storage where the OS manages disk space
  - UpsellBanner was already fully gutted in US-003/US-014, so no cleanup needed in storage.tsx
  - The sidebar item name comes from the same translation key (`pageSettingsSpaceRemoteStorage`) used in both the sidebar and the storage page title — changing the translation once updates both
- **Browser verification:** Confirmed via CDP connection to Electron. Storage settings page renders correctly: title "Storage", description "Your files are stored locally on this device.", progress bar with local usage, "Files" section (not "Synced files"), sidebar shows "Storage" (not "Remote Storage"). No upgrade prompts, no sync status, no "not synced" section. Zero visible errors and zero console errors on the page.
- **Critical browser testing learnings:**
  - The heart server must be started with TWO port arguments (`127.0.0.1:0 127.0.0.1:0`) — port 1 is raw gRPC, port 2 is gRPC-web proxy. The app's dispatcher uses gRPC-web, so `ANYTYPE_USE_SIDE_SERVER` MUST point to the web proxy port, not the gRPC port. Using the wrong port causes silent timeouts.
  - ISP must be called before AccountSelect. The app auto-logins on start, causing a panic if ISP wasn't called. Solution: call ISP on first launch via CDP, then restart Electron — the server remembers ISP state.
  - To navigate to settings via CDP: find `m.Action.openSettings` via webpack require, then call `Action.openSettings('spaceStorage', 'settings')`.

---

## US-018: Add vault export functionality to settings
- **Files modified:**
  - `src/ts/component/page/main/settings/data/index.tsx` — Added Export vault action item and `onExportVault` handler
  - `src/json/text.json` — Added 4 translation keys (popupSettingsDataExportVaultTitle, Description, Success, Error)
  - `src/scss/page/main/settings.scss` — Added `.icon.export` background-image rule
  - `src/scss/theme/dark/page.scss` — Added `.icon.export` dark theme rule
- **Key decisions:**
  - Used `C.ObjectListExport` directly instead of `Action.export()` because `Action.export` has a bug: on gRPC error it returns early without calling the callback, so `setLoading(false)` would never fire
  - Used `Action.openDirectoryDialog` for native directory picker, then `C.ObjectListExport` with empty objectIds array (exports entire space) in Protobuf format
  - Loading spinner shown only after user picks a directory (not before)
  - Error handling: shows confirm popup with error message; success: opens export directory + shows success popup
- **Patterns discovered:**
  - Data management settings items follow: `.item` > `.side.left` (Icon + `.txt` (Title + Label)) + `.side.right` (Button)
  - Icon assets exist at `src/img/icon/settings/<name>.svg` (light) and `src/img/icon/settings/dark/<name>.svg` (dark)
  - `Action.export()` returns on error without callback — use direct gRPC call when you need error handling in the callback
- **Browser verification:** Confirmed via CDP. Data settings page shows all 3 items: Local files (8.66MB used), Data location, Export vault with description and Export button. Renders correctly in dark theme.
- **CDP/Electron testing learnings:**
  - `--remote-debugging-port=9222` must be passed to the `npx electron .` command directly, not as npm arg (npm doesn't forward through npm-run-all)
  - Added `start:dev-debug` npm script chain (`electron:debug` → `start:electron-wait-rspack-debug` → `start:dev-debug`) to properly pass CDP flag
  - `ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS` does NOT work with `npx electron .` (only packaged apps)
  - Reusable CDP helper scripts: `.playwright-mcp/cdp.js` (eval expressions) and `.playwright-mcp/screenshot.js` (capture screenshots)

---

## 2026-02-10 - US-019
- What was implemented: Added vault import functionality to Settings > Data Management
- Files changed:
  - `src/ts/component/page/main/settings/data/index.tsx` — Added Import data action item and `onImportVault` handler using `Action.openFileDialog` + `C.ObjectImport` with Protobuf format
  - `src/json/text.json` — Added 4 translation keys (popupSettingsDataImportVaultTitle, Description, Success, Error)
  - `src/scss/page/main/settings.scss` — Added `.icon.import` background-image rule
  - `src/scss/theme/dark/page.scss` — Added `.icon.import` dark theme rule
  - `tasks/prd.json` — Marked US-019 as passing
- **Key decisions:**
  - Used `C.ObjectImport` directly instead of `Action.import()` because `Action.import` returns early on gRPC error without calling the callback, so `setLoading(false)` would never fire (same pattern as export in US-018)
  - Used `Action.openFileDialog` with protobuf extensions from `J.Constant.fileExtension.import[I.ImportType.Protobuf]` (`['zip', 'pb', 'json']`)
  - Shows toast notification when import starts (reusing existing `toastImportStart` key), loading spinner during import
  - Error handling: shows confirm popup with error message for corrupt/incompatible files
  - Success: shows success confirm popup
  - Used `I.ImportMode.IgnoreErrors` to be lenient with partial imports (same as existing import infrastructure)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import icon (`import.svg`) already exists in both `src/img/icon/settings/` and dark theme at `src/img/theme/dark/icon/settings/`
  - `J.Constant.fileExtension.import` maps `I.ImportType` enum values to allowed file extensions — key `3` = Protobuf = `['zip', 'pb', 'json']`
  - `Action.import()` in `action.ts` has a bug: on `message.error.code` it returns without calling the callback — always use `C.ObjectImport` directly when you need guaranteed cleanup (like `setLoading(false)`)
  - The existing import page at `settings/import/index.tsx` handles multiple import formats (Notion, Markdown, HTML, etc.) — this vault import is a simplified single-action version specifically for Protobuf vault backups
- **Browser verification:** Confirmed via CDP. Data settings page shows all 4 items: Local files, Data location, Export vault, Import data with description and Import button. No console errors. Icon renders correctly.
